					## V-Model

					* Common and often required in US government projects
					* Intended to minimize complex project cost, schedule and technical risk
					* Validation: did we *build the right system*?
					* Verification: did we *built the system right*?

					----

					## Russel and Norvig
					---

					* Problem Formulation: *"what problem do I want to solve for my users?"*
					* Data collection, assessment, and management
						* Do you have enough data? Do you understand its provenance?
						* Feature engineering
						* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
					* Model selection and training
						* e.g., neural network vs. random forest?
						* Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves

					--

					* Trust, interpretability, and explainability
						* Source control, testing, review, monitoring, accountability
						* Interpretability: inspect the *model* to determine why a particular input caused an output?
						* Explainability: the model can be a black-box but *other processes* (integrated gradients) explain what it is doing
					* Operation, monitoring, and maintenance
						* Strict requirement
						* Long tail problem
						* Non-stationarity problem

					----

					## Goodfellow
					---

					* Determine your goals
						* What error metric to use with what target value?
					* Establish a working end-to-end pipeline as soon as possible
						* Include data, training, and estimation of performance metrics

					--

					* Instrument the system
						* Determine bottlenecks and diagnose which components are performing poorly
					* Repeatedly make incremental changes
						* Adjust data, hyperparameters, or algorithms based on findings

					## Google

					--

					* Ideation and planning
						* Determine if ML is the right solution and what metrics it must meet
					* Experimentation
						* Develop a high performing model that solves the problem
					* Pipeline building
						* Implement infrastructure to scale, monitor, and maintain models in production
					* Productionization
						* Deploy and monitor the system
